# 2-Tier-HA
2 Tier high availability AWS architecture

This 2 tier high availability AWS architecture consists of the ec2 instances as the frontend and the RDS database as the backend.

Uses Load balancer to balance out the traffic between the instances equally.

Uses auto-scaling group to scale up during high traffic and down during low traffic periods.
